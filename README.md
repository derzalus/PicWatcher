# PicWatcher

PicWatcher is a simple Matrix bot that checks if users in a room have a profile picture (avatar). If a user does not have a profile picture, the bot sends a polite reminder to update their avatar.

## Features:
- Checks profile pictures of all users in a specified Matrix room.
- Sends a message to users without profile pictures asking them to update.
- Lightweight and easy to use.
- Can be customized for other tasks and checks.
